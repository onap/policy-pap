So the job of PAP will be just to create PDP_UPDATE message and put it on DMAAP topic. \nAt this point the request that came from REST API is done.\nAnd we won\u0027t have info to create this response object.\n\nHowever, the response from PDP side will come through PDP_STATUS message. Which will be handled by PAP to modify the DB.",

See Jorge\u0027s comments in one of the other reviews (or in the draft architecture?) about making the REST API calls synchronous, rather than requiring clients to query a second time for results.",

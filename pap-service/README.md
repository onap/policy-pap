# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/  

Change default port value in application.properties


## Running PAP prototype
The prototype expects a maria db instance running on localhost port 3306. This can be changed in pap-service\src\main\resources\META-INF\persistence.xml. 
The location files are to be downloaded to from nexus is specified by property nexus_download_dir in pap-service\src\main\resources\pap.properties. The nexus user name and password in this properties file are not currently used. 
To run the PAP simply run the Swagger2SpringBoot class. This will bring up the PAP using port 8080 (port can be changed in pap-service\src\main\resources\application.properties).
To exercise the code, the PDP prototype should be started.

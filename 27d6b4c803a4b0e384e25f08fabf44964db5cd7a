This was discussed by Jim Hahn on the Policy Rocketchat but you may not be on there yet.\n\nHere\u0027s the fix:\nanyone running into issues with sonarlint, lombok, and eclipse 2019? I was and went looking on the web for a fix just this morning, and found a lombok patch to fix it that was released just this morning - good timing! https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/2351",
